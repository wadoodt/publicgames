# publicgames - My projects that I want to share with the world

Chess

In order for the game to run as needed, you need to download assets folder into the working directory of the project (where the 'client' and 'chess_complete are').

The server should be ran first and then 2 clients should connect to it. Once 2 connections with the server are made, then the game will immediately start.

Chess_complete is an offline version of the game. # P.S. You could change the code for the draw_window function and it will not rotate the board around

To move in the game you have to click on the piece and then onto the tile you want to move it to. 

If the piece does not move, then it means that you tried moving the piece where it cannot move. 

If you find a bug, please, do contact me. Thank you.

If you won the game in the offline version, then if you press on the screen, the game will start again in less than 5 seconds.
If you won the game in the online version, then you need to enter 'switch' or 'again' to either swap sides or stay on the same sides to play again.

Hope you will enjoy the game!

P.S. 
I have not used any classes, however now I know how to use them and kind of regret it as 2 functions can have some common functionality, therefore the code would be shorter. Also, I do realise now I could probably shorten it by quite a bit, but back then (2 months ago) all I wanted is to make it happen. So, the same project now would look differet if I were to do it again. But, I am happy, nevertheless. 

P.S. It may be useful to export executable for your own comfort. When you will run the game console will appear alongside the game.
